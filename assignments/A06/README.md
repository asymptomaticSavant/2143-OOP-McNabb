K.C.M.

> Layout:

    - Transcript is an class, composed of a student object, which in-turn is composed of one schedule object, and several grade objects; GPA is a variable contained within [the student object].

    - Arguments/defense-wise, the priority is following the read of the assignment, which suggests transcript as the final output/goal; the following priority is readability/understandability from a user's P.O.V.
        - There are some downsides, such as information being doubly stored, and a strict hiercharchy not suited for borrowing, but readability is prioritized.
